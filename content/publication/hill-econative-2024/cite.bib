  abstract = {Conservation biologists recognize a duty to maintain as much value as possible in ecosystems that are threatened by recent anthropogenic impacts. Until recently the paradigm of contemporary conservation seemed relatively straightforward: the best way to maintain the value of species and ecosystems at a given location was to maintain---or shepherd the system back towards---historical conditions. Among the most difficult theoretical tasks was the determination of ``baseline'' historical conditions (or trajectories) to return to, recognizing the dynamism of ecosystems over time. However, the rate, scale, and magnitude of contemporary climate change, species introductions, and land-use change make it increasingly impractical to return locations to any kind of historical state. This forces a paradigm shift which is both ongoing and difficult, and necessitates a rigorous evaluation of the scientific and ethical foundations of modern conservation along with a careful reexamination of terminology. Here, I discuss the moral relevance and waning utility of the geographically-based and dichotomous understanding of ``native'' (or ``in situ'') which is an important component of conservation ethics and practice. I then propose a new understanding of nativeness in which a species is native---not to a geographic location---but to a quantifiable set of biotic, climatic, geologic, and topographic conditions (i.e. its niche) that can then map to geographic space. Following this, I demonstrate the unique utility of this concept, which I will refer to as ``econativeness,'' in thinking through conservation problems---range expansions, range contractions, species introductions, and assisted migration---where the classical understanding of nativeness has become increasingly inadequate for assessing the moral value of species.},

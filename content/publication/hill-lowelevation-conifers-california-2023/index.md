abstract: "Since the 1930s, California's Sierra Nevada has warmed
  by an average of 1.2$∘$C. Warming directly primes forests for easier wildfire ignition,
  but the change in climate also affects vegetation species composition. Different
  types of vegetation support unique fire regimes with distinct probabilities of catastrophic
  wildfire, and anticipating vegetation transitions is an important but undervalued
  component of long-term wildfire management and adaptation. Vegetation transitions
  are more likely where the climate has become unsuitable but the species composition
  remains static. This vegetation climate mismatch (VCM) can result in vegetation
  conversions, particularly after a disturbance like wildfire. Here we produce estimates
  of VCM within conifer-dominated forests in the Sierra Nevada. Observations from
  the 1930s Wieslander Survey provide a foundation for characterizing the historical
  relationship between Sierra Nevada vegetation and climate before the onset of recent,
  rapid climate change. Based on comparing the historical climatic niche to the modern
  distribution of conifers and climate, $∼$19.5% of modern Sierra Nevada coniferous
  forests are experiencing VCM, 95% of which is below an elevation of 2356 m. We found
  that these VCM estimates carry empirical consequences: likelihood of type-conversion
  increased by 9.2% for every 10% decrease in habitat suitability. Maps of Sierra
  Nevada VCM can help guide long-term land management decisions by distinguishing
  areas likely to transition from those expected to remain stable in the near future.
  This can help direct limited resources to their most effective uses---whether it
  be protecting land or managing vegetation transitions---in the effort to maintain
  biodiversity, ecosystem services, and public health in the Sierra Nevada."
summary: "Warming climatic conditions over the last century have led to observable shifts in the spatial organization of dominant tree species in California’s Sierra Nevada. Little is known, however, about the extent to which these shifts have tracked the magnitude of climate change. This study maps Vegetation Climate Mismatch in the Sierra Nevada—areas where climate change has left trees in climatic conditions where they have not historically occurred. Different vegetation types support different wildfire regimes, ecosystems, and ecosystem services. Our maps will be useful for anticipating vegetation transitions and informing long-term wildfire and ecosystem management across the Sierra Nevada mountains of California."

abstract: Due to climate change, plant populations experience
  environmental conditions to which they are not adapted. Our understanding of the
  next century's vegetation geography depends on the distance, direction, and rate
  at which plant distributions shift in response to a changing climate. In this study
  we test the sensitivity of tree range shifts (measured as the difference between
  seedling and mature tree ranges in climate space) to wildfire occurrence, using
  74,069 Forest Inventory Analysis plots across nine states in the western United
  States. Wildfire significantly increased the seedling-only range displacement for
  2 of the 8 tree species in which seedling-only plots were displaced from tree-plus-seedling
  plots in the same direction with and without recent fire. The direction of climatic
  displacement was consistent with that expected for warmer and drier conditions.
  The greater seedling-only range displacement observed across burned plots suggests
  that fire can accelerate climate-related range shifts and that fire and fire management
  will play a role in the rate of vegetation redistribution in response to climate
  change.

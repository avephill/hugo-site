abstract: \"The Anthropocene\" is challenging the established conceptions of biogeography. In an age of widespread disturbance, global commerce, and a rapidly changing climate, some species have the opportunity to access new, vast areas while others disappear at unprecedented rates and scales, along with the environments to which they are adapted. The \"native vs. alien\" conceptual framework for determining which species \"belong\" in an environment is naive and insufficient in facing the novel biogeographic dynamics of the Anthropocene, as are the wilderness management practices derived from it. Though conservation practitioners have come a long way in addressing some limits of the native/alien dichotomy, there are many domains where this paradigm persists and continues to influence. Here, we argue that no species will be truly \"native\" in the Anthropocene, and a new set of criteria to determine the \"belonging\" of a species to a locality is necessary for the establishment of management practices that reconcile the veracity of global change with realistic options for the preservation of biodiversity.

The **Zombie Forests Explorer** is an interactive web application for exploring regions of conifer forests in the Sierra Nevada mountains that are at risk of loss due to climate change - what we call "zombie forests." These forests are out of equilibrium with current climate conditions and face heightened vulnerability to wildfire and ecological transition.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Mapping**: Explore spatial patterns of vegetation-climate mismatch across the Sierra Nevada
- **Climate Analysis**: Visualize current and projected climate conditions relative to forest habitat requirements
- **Fire Risk Assessment**: Examine fire behavior and risk patterns in zombie forest regions
- **Species Distribution**: Investigate how climate mismatch affects individual conifer species
- **Temporal Analysis**: Track changes in forest vulnerability over time
- **Management Insights**: Explore implications for forest conservation and management

## Scientific Foundation

This application is built on research identifying conifer forests that are climatically out of equilibrium, published in:

- **Hill et al. (2023)** - [Low-Elevation Conifers in California's Sierra Nevada Are out of Equilibrium with Climate](https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad004). _PNAS Nexus_
- **Hill & Field (2021)** - [Forest Fires and Climate-Induced Tree Range Shifts in the Western US](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-26838-z). _Nature Communications_

## Applications

- **Conservation Planning**: Identify priority areas for forest protection and restoration
- **Fire Management**: Understand fire risk patterns in climatically mismatched forests
- **Research Tool**: Explore real-time case studies of vegetation-climate relationships
- **Policy Support**: Inform climate adaptation strategies for forest ecosystems
- **Education**: Visualize climate change impacts on forest ecosystems

## Data Integration

The app combines multiple datasets including climate data, vegetation maps, fire history, and species distribution models to provide a comprehensive view of forest vulnerability in a changing climate.

Developed by **Avery P. Hill** in collaboration with researchers at Stanford University and the California Academy of Sciences.

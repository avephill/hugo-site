The **San Francisco iNaturalist Coverage Explorer** is an interactive mapping application that visualizes biodiversity observations and spatial coverage patterns across San Francisco using community science data from iNaturalist.

## Key Features

- **Taxonomic Filtering**: Explore data by different taxonomic classes including birds, mammals, insects, plants, and more
- **Spatial Coverage Analysis**: View observation density and species richness patterns across the city
- **High-Quality Data**: Only includes records with spatial accuracy better than 500 meters
- **Interactive Mapping**: Pan and zoom through San Francisco to explore local biodiversity hotspots
- **Aggregation Options**: Toggle between raw observation counts and distinct species counts

## Data Details

- **Data Source**: Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)
- **Data Currency**: Downloaded September 1st, 2024
- **Quality Filter**: Only records with <500m spatial error included
- **Geographic Scope**: San Francisco city boundaries

This application provides insights into:

- **Urban biodiversity patterns** across different neighborhoods
- **Sampling effort distribution** throughout the city
- **Species richness hotspots** and observation gaps
- **Taxonomic biases** in community science observations

## Applications

- Urban ecology research and analysis
- Conservation planning for urban environments
- Identifying under-sampled areas for targeted biodiversity surveys
- Educational tool for understanding urban wildlife distribution
- Community engagement with local biodiversity

Developed by **Avery P. Hill**, Postdoctoral Researcher in the Center for Biodiversity and Community Science at the California Academy of Sciences.

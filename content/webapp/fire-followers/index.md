The **CNPS Fire Followers Explorer** is an interactive web application designed to explore plant biodiversity patterns before and after wildfire events in California. This tool allows users to visualize and analyze how plant communities respond to fires of different severities and how species composition changes over time.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Fire Selection**: Choose from major California wildfires to explore their ecological impacts
- **Biodiversity Analysis**: Compare pre-fire and post-fire plant communities using iNaturalist observation data
- **Fire Severity Mapping**: Visualize burn severity patterns using MTBS (Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity) data
- **Species-Level Insights**: Track changes in individual species abundance and distribution
- **Data Export**: Download filtered observation data for further analysis

## Data Sources

- **Observation Data**: iNaturalist California Fire Followers 2020 project
- **Fire Perimeters**: California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE)
- **Fire Severity**: Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) project

This application was developed as a collaboration between the **California Native Plant Society** and **Avery Hill** at the California Academy of Sciences, built using R Shiny with DuckDB for efficient data processing.

## Use Cases

- Research into post-fire plant community recovery
- Conservation planning for fire-prone landscapes
- Educational tool for understanding fire ecology
- Community science data exploration and validation

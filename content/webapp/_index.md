Welcome to my collection of interactive web applications! These tools showcase the intersection of ecological research, data science, and community engagement. Each application is designed to make complex biodiversity and environmental data accessible and explorable for researchers, educators, and the general public.

## Research Focus Areas

üî• **Fire Ecology** - Tools for exploring post-fire vegetation recovery and plant community dynamics

üå≤ **Forest Conservation** - Applications examining climate-forest relationships and conservation planning

üèôÔ∏è **Urban Biodiversity** - Interactive maps and tools for understanding biodiversity patterns in urban environments

üìä **Community Science** - Platforms that leverage iNaturalist and other community-collected data for research

## Technical Approach

These applications are built using modern web technologies including:

- **R Shiny** for interactive data visualization and analysis
- **DuckDB** for efficient data processing and storage
- **Spatial analysis libraries** for geographic data handling
- **Community science APIs** for real-time data integration

All applications are designed with accessibility, performance, and scientific rigor in mind, providing both exploratory interfaces for general users and detailed analytical capabilities for researchers.

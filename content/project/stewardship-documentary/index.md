I’m also interested in understanding the characteristics of effective and egalitarian land stewardship, and what it will take to actualize it across managed lands. I’m working with a group of Stanford students and postdocs, funded by the [McCoy Ethics, Society, and Technology Grant](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/tech-ethics/ethics-society-and-technology-hub/2022-collaborative-research-projects), to make a mini-documentary about the relationship between effective stewardship and land sovereignty, and the importance of diversity in conservation.
